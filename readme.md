### Julian Alps (Lake Bohinj/Pokljuka)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I'm only highlighting three hikes here, but we have a bit of a "choose your own adventure" situation. These three cover most of the ground in this region, but you can pretty much hut-to-hut hike wherever you like. [So if we don't like any of these three, we can cook up something that fits better.](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1jACftoMpXEUrzFr3Fde3tbTeFiYxkpQk&femb=1&ll=46.24001095051293%2C14.050584973397118&z=11)

#### Food
- **Fritolin Pri Cantini:** This place became popular recently, offering a cheaper alternative to other high-end seafood restaurants in Piran. It is a very small restaurant, looks more like a street food stall, located on the scenic 1st or May Square, and offers a chance to enjoy the local atmosphere of this quiet square while indulging in some delicious local seafood.
- **Pirat Piran:** Pirat is one of the restaurants that has been popular in Piran for many years. I remember coming here as a child! Probably the best seafood restaurant in town.
- **Restaurants at Prešernovo nabrežje Street:** There are many restaurants lined up by the sea down the Prešernovo nabrežje street. This is a great walking area by the sea, connecting Tartini Square with the Punta lighthouse. The food here is decent and the atmosphere is relaxing.
- **Sarajevo 84:** If you are tired of seafood this is a place to go! Traditional Bosnian cuisine offers mostly meat dishes. This one is one of the local’s favourites!

You will find many more dining options in the lively and busy town of Portorož, just next to Piran. Here are some of the recommendations:
- **Pizzeria Porto Konoba:** Best pizza on the Slovenian coast. They also have a choice of seafood and meat dishes available. 
- **Restaurant Staro sidro:** Great fine dining restaurant choice near Piran. Great views and amazing cuisine.
- **COP:** If you enjoy trying new things, the dining experience at the COP is for you! Awarded with 1 Michelin Star
